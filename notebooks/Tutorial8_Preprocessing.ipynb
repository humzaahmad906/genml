      "[<Document: {'content': 'BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for\\nLanguage Understanding\\nJacob Devlin Ming-Wei Chang Kenton Lee Kristina Toutanova\\nGoogle AI Language\\n{jacobdevlin,mingweichang,kentonl,kristout}@google.com\\nAbstract\\nWe introduce a new language representa-\\ntion model called BERT, which stands for\\nBidirectional Encoder Representations from\\nTransformers. Unlike recent language repre-\\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\\ntuned with just one additional output layer\\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on eleven natural language processing\\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\\n1 Introduction\\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\\nbe effective for improving many natural language\\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\\nThere are two existing strategies for apply-\\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\\nstream tasks: feature-based and ﬁne-tuning. The\\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\\net al., 2018a), uses task-speciﬁc architectures that\\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\\ntional features. The ﬁne-tuning approach, such as\\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\\ntask-speciﬁc parameters, and is trained on the\\ndownstream tasks by simply ﬁne-tuning all pre-\\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\\ngeneral language representations.\\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\\ncially for the ﬁne-tuning approaches. The ma-\\njor limitation is that standard language models are\\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-\\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\\nand could be very harmful when applying ﬁne-\\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\\nporate context from both directions.\\nIn this paper, we improve the ﬁne-tuning based\\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\\nEncoder Representations from Transformers.\\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\\nrectionality constraint by using a “masked lan-\\nguage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\\nspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The\\nmasked language model randomly masks some of\\nthe tokens from the input, and the objective is to\\npredict the original vocabulary id of the masked\\narXiv:1810.04805v2 [cs.CL] 24 May 2019\\x0cword based only on its context. Unlike left-to-\\nright language model pre-training, the MLM ob-\\njective enables the representation to fuse the left\\nand the right context, which allows us to pre-\\ntrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi-\\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\\na “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-\\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\\nof our paper are as follows:\\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\\npre-training for language representations. Un-\\nlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-\\ntional language models for pre-training, BERT\\nuses masked language models to enable pre-\\ntrained deep bidirectional representations. This\\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\\n• We show that pre-trained representations reduce\\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task-\\nspeciﬁc architectures. BERT is the ﬁrst ﬁne-\\ntuning based representation model that achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\\nof sentence-level and token-level tasks, outper-\\nforming many task-speciﬁc architectures.\\n• BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\\nNLP tasks. The code and pre-trained mod-\\nels are available at https://github.com/\\ngoogle-research/bert.\\n2 Related Work\\nThere is a long history of pre-training general lan-\\nguage representations, and we brieﬂy review the\\nmost widely-used approaches in this section.\\n2.1 Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches\\nLearning widely applicable representations of\\nwords has been an active area of research for\\ndecades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;\\nAndo and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and\\nneural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,\\n2014) methods. Pre-trained word embeddings\\nare an integral part of modern NLP systems, of-\\nfering signiﬁcant improvements over embeddings\\nlearned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre-\\ntrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-\\nguage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis-\\ncriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).\\nThese approaches have been generalized to\\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed-\\ndings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,\\n2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,\\n2014). To train sentence representations, prior\\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen-\\ntence words given a representation of the previous\\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto-\\nencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re-\\nsearch along a different dimension. They extract\\ncontext-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a\\nright-to-left language model. The contextual rep-\\nresentation of each token is the concatenation of\\nthe left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\\nWhen integrating contextual word embeddings\\nwith existing task-speciﬁc architectures, ELMo\\nadvances the state of the art for several major NLP\\nbenchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques-\\ntion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment\\nanalysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity\\nrecognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,\\n2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning\\ncontextual representations through a task to pre-\\ndict a single word from both left and right context\\nusing LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is\\nfeature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus\\net al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used\\nto improve the robustness of text generation mod-\\nels.\\n2.2 Unsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the ﬁrst\\nworks in this direction only pre-trained word em-\\nbedding parameters from unlabeled text (Col-\\nlobert and Weston, 2008).\\nMore recently, sentence or document encoders\\nwhich produce contextual token representations\\nhave been pre-trained from unlabeled text and\\nﬁne-tuned for a supervised downstream task (Dai\\nand Le, 2015; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford\\net al., 2018). The advantage of these approaches\\nis that few parameters need to be learned from\\nscratch. At least partly due to this advantage,\\nOpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) achieved pre-\\nviously state-of-the-art results on many sentence-\\nlevel tasks from the GLUE benchmark (Wang\\net al., 2018a).

Apart from output layers, the same architec-\\ntures are used in both pre-training and ﬁne-tuning. The same pre-trained model parameters are used to initialize\\nmodels for different down-stream tasks. During ﬁne-tuning, all parameters are ﬁne-tuned. [CLS] is a special\\nsymbol added in front of every input example, and [SEP] is a special separator token (e.g. separating ques-\\ntions/answers).\\ning and auto-encoder objectives have been used\\nfor pre-training such models (Howard and Ruder,\\n2018; Radford et al., 2018; Dai and Le, 2015).\\n2.3 Transfer Learning from Supervised Data\\nThere has also been work showing effective trans-\\nfer from supervised tasks with large datasets, such\\nas natural language inference (Conneau et al.,\\n2017) and machine translation (McCann et al.,\\n2017). Computer vision research has also demon-\\nstrated the importance of transfer learning from\\nlarge pre-trained models, where an effective recipe\\nis to ﬁne-tune models pre-trained with Ima-\\ngeNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).\\n3 BERT\\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementa-\\ntion in this section. There are two steps in our\\nframework: pre-training and ﬁne-tuning. Dur-\\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For ﬁne-\\ntuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\\neters are ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the\\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\\narate ﬁne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\\nas a running example for this section.\\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-\\nmal difference between the pre-trained architec-\\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec-\\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\\nthe tensor2tensor library.1 Because the use\\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\\nsuch as “The Annotated Transformer.”2\\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\\nBERTBASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\\neters=110M) and BERTLARGE (L=24, H=1024,\\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\\nBERTBASE was chosen to have the same model\\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans-\\nformer uses constrained self-attention where every\\ntoken can only attend to context to its left.4\\n1https://github.com/tensorﬂow/tensor2tensor\\n2http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html\\n3In all cases we set the feed-forward/ﬁlter size to be 4H,\\ni.e., 3072 for the H = 768 and 4096 for the H = 1024.\\n4We note that in the literature the bidirectional Trans-\\x0cInput/Output Representations To make BERT\\nhandle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input\\nrepresentation is able to unambiguously represent\\nboth a single sentence and a pair of sentences\\n(e.g., Question, Answer ) in one token sequence.\\nThroughout this work, a “sentence” can be an arbi-\\ntrary span of contiguous text, rather than an actual\\nlinguistic sentence. A “sequence” refers to the in-\\nput token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin-\\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The ﬁrst\\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\\nsiﬁcation token ([CLS]). The ﬁnal hidden state\\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\\ngregate sequence representation for classiﬁcation\\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\\ntoken ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embed-\\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\\nto sentence A or sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\\nwe denote input embedding as E, the ﬁnal hidden\\nvector of the special [CLS] token as C ∈ RH,\\nand the ﬁnal hidden vector for the ith input token\\nas Ti ∈ RH.\\nFor a given token, its input representation is\\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza-\\ntion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\\n3.1 Pre-training BERT\\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper-\\nvised tasks, described in this section. This step\\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\\nTask #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reason-\\nable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to-\\nright and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately,\\nstandard conditional language models can only be\\ntrained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirec-\\ntional conditioning would allow each word to in-\\ndirectly “see itself”, and the model could trivially\\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\\nformer is often referred to as a “Transformer encoder” while\\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a “Transformer\\ndecoder” since it can be used for text generation.\\nIn order to train a deep bidirectional representa-\\ntion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\\ntokens. We refer to this procedure as a “masked\\nLM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\\nCloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this\\ncase, the ﬁnal hidden vectors corresponding to the\\nmask tokens are fed into an output softmax over\\nthe vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our\\nexperiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to-\\nkens in each sequence at random. In contrast to\\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\\nonly predict the masked words rather than recon-\\nstructing the entire input.\\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirec-\\ntional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\\nﬁne-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap-\\npear during ﬁne-tuning. To mitigate this, we do\\nnot always replace “masked” words with the ac-\\ntual [MASK] token. The training data generator\\nchooses 15% of the token positions at random for\\nprediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace\\nthe i-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then,\\nTi will be used to predict the original token with\\ncross entropy loss. We compare variations of this\\nprocedure in Appendix C.2.\\nTask #2: Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)\\nMany important downstream tasks such as Ques-\\ntion Answering (QA) and Natural Language Infer-\\nence (NLI) are based on understanding the rela-\\ntionship between two sentences, which is not di-\\nrectly captured by language modeling. In order\\nto train a model that understands sentence rela-\\ntionships, we pre-train for a binarized next sen-\\ntence prediction task that can be trivially gener-\\nated from any monolingual corpus. Speciﬁcally,\\nwhen choosing the sentences A and B for each pre-\\ntraining example, 50% of the time B is the actual\\nnext sentence that follows A (labeled as IsNext),\\nand 50% of the time it is a random sentence from\\nthe corpus (labeled as NotNext). As we show\\nin Figure 1, C is used for next sentence predic-\\ntion (NSP).5 Despite its simplicity, we demon-\\nstrate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this\\ntask is very beneﬁcial to both QA and NLI. 6\\n5The ﬁnal model achieves 97%-98% accuracy on NSP.\\n6The vector C is not a meaningful sentence representation\\nwithout ﬁne-tuning, since it was trained with NSP.\\x0c[CLS] he likes play ##ing [SEP]\\nmy dog is cute [SEP]\\nInput\\nE\\n[CLS]\\nE\\nhe\\nE\\nlikes\\nE\\nplay\\nE\\n##ing\\nE\\n[SEP]\\nE\\nmy\\nE\\ndog\\nE\\nis\\nE\\ncute\\nE\\n[SEP]\\nToken\\nEmbeddings\\nE\\nA\\nE\\nB\\nE\\nB\\nE\\nB\\nE\\nB\\nE\\nB\\nE\\nA\\nE\\nA\\nE\\nA\\nE\\nA\\nE\\nA\\nSegment\\nEmbeddings\\nE\\n0\\nE\\n6\\nE\\n7\\nE\\n8\\nE\\n9\\nE\\n10\\nE\\n1\\nE\\n2\\nE\\n3\\nE\\n4\\nE\\n5\\nPosition\\nEmbeddings\\nFigure 2: BERT input representation. The input embeddings are the sum of the token embeddings, the segmenta-\\ntion embeddings and the position embeddings.\\nThe NSP task is closely related to representation-\\nlearning objectives used in Jernite et al. (2017) and\\nLogeswaran and Lee (2018). However, in prior\\nwork, only sentence embeddings are transferred to\\ndown-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all pa-\\nrameters to initialize end-task model parameters.\\nPre-training data The pre-training procedure\\nlargely follows the existing literature on language\\nmodel pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we\\nuse the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al.,\\n2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\\nFor Wikipedia we extract only the text passages\\nand ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is criti-\\ncal to use a document-level corpus rather than a\\nshufﬂed sentence-level corpus such as the Billion\\nWord Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to\\nextract long contiguous sequences.\\n3.2 Fine-tuning BERT\\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self-\\nattention mechanism in the Transformer al-\\nlows BERT to model many downstream tasks—\\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs—by\\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be-\\nfore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\\nspeciﬁc inputs and outputs into BERT and ﬁne-\\ntune all the parameters end-to-end. At the in-\\nput, sentence A and sentence B from pre-training\\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras-\\ning, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and\\n(4) a degenerate text-∅ pair in text classiﬁcation\\nor sequence tagging. At the output, the token rep-\\nresentations are fed into an output layer for token-\\nlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question\\nanswering, and the [CLS] representation is fed\\ninto an output layer for classiﬁcation, such as en-\\ntailment or sentiment analysis.\\nCompared to pre-training, ﬁne-tuning is rela-\\ntively inexpensive. All of the results in the pa-\\nper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a sin-\\ngle Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting\\nfrom the exact same pre-trained model.7 We de-\\nscribe the task-speciﬁc details in the correspond-\\ning subsections of Section 4. More details can be\\nfound in Appendix A.5.\\n4 Experiments\\nIn this section, we present BERT ﬁne-tuning re-\\nsults on 11 NLP tasks.\\n4.1 GLUE\\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation\\n(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a col-\\nlection of diverse natural language understanding\\ntasks. Detailed descriptions of GLUE datasets are\\nincluded in Appendix B.1.\\nTo ﬁne-tune on GLUE, we represent the input\\nsequence (for single sentence or sentence pairs)\\nas described in Section 3, and use the ﬁnal hid-\\nden vector C ∈ RH corresponding to the ﬁrst\\ninput token ([CLS]) as the aggregate representa-\\ntion. The only new parameters introduced during\\nﬁne-tuning are classiﬁcation layer weights W ∈\\nRK×H, where K is the number of labels. We com-\\npute a standard classiﬁcation loss with C and W,\\ni.e., log(softmax(CWT )).\\n7For example, the BERT SQuAD model can be trained in\\naround 30 minutes on a single Cloud TPU to achieve a Dev\\nF1 score of 91.0%.\\n8See (10) in https://gluebenchmark.com/faq.\\x0cSystem MNLI-(m/mm) QQP QNLI SST-2 CoLA STS-B MRPC RTE Average\\n392k 363k 108k 67k 8.5k 5.7k 3.5k 2.5k -\\nPre-OpenAI SOTA 80.6/80.1 66.1 82.3 93.2 35.0 81.0 86.0 61.7 74.0\\nBiLSTM+ELMo+Attn 76.4/76.1 64.8 79.8 90.4 36.0 73.3 84.9 56.8 71.0\\nOpenAI GPT 82.1/81.4 70.3 87.4 91.3 45.4 80.0 82.3 56.0 75.1\\nBERTBASE 84.6/83.4 71.2 90.5 93.5 52.1 85.8 88.9 66.4 79.6\\nBERTLARGE\\n86.7/85.9 72.1 92.7 94.9 60.5 86.5 89.3 70.1 82.1\\nTable 1: GLUE Test results, scored by the evaluation server (https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard).\\nThe number below each task denotes the number of training examples. The “Average” column is slightly different\\nthan the ofﬁcial GLUE score, since we exclude the problematic WNLI set.8 BERT and OpenAI GPT are single-\\nmodel, single task. F1 scores are reported for QQP and MRPC, Spearman correlations are reported for STS-B, and\\naccuracy scores are reported for the other tasks. We exclude entries that use BERT as one of their components.\\nWe use a batch size of 32 and ﬁne-tune for 3\\nepochs over the data for all GLUE tasks. For each\\ntask, we selected the best ﬁne-tuning learning rate\\n(among 5e-5, 4e-5, 3e-5, and 2e-5) on the Dev set.\\nAdditionally, for BERTLARGE we found that ﬁne-\\ntuning was sometimes unstable on small datasets,\\nso we ran several random restarts and selected the\\nbest model on the Dev set. With random restarts,\\nwe use the same pre-trained checkpoint but per-\\nform different ﬁne-tuning data shufﬂing and clas-\\nsiﬁer layer initialization.9\\nResults are presented in Table 1. Both\\nBERTBASE and BERTLARGE outperform all sys-\\ntems on all tasks by a substantial margin, obtaining\\n4.5% and 7.0% respective average accuracy im-\\nprovement over the prior state of the art. Note that\\nBERTBASE and OpenAI GPT are nearly identical\\nin terms of model architecture apart from the at-\\ntention masking. For the largest and most widely\\nreported GLUE task, MNLI, BERT obtains a 4.6%\\nabsolute accuracy improvement. On the ofﬁcial\\nGLUE leaderboard10, BERTLARGE obtains a score\\nof 80.5, compared to OpenAI GPT, which obtains\\n72.8 as of the date of writing.\\nWe ﬁnd that BERTLARGE signiﬁcantly outper-\\nforms BERTBASE across all tasks, especially those\\nwith very little training data. The effect of model\\nsize is explored more thoroughly in Section 5.2.\\n4.2 SQuAD v1.1\\nThe Stanford Question Answering Dataset\\n(SQuAD v1.1) is a collection of 100k crowd-\\nsourced question/answer pairs (Rajpurkar et al.,\\n2016). Given a question and a passage from\\n9The GLUE data set distribution does not include the Test\\nlabels, and we only made a single GLUE evaluation server\\nsubmission for each of BERTBASE and BERTLARGE.\\n10https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard\\nWikipedia containing the answer, the task is to\\npredict the answer text span in the passage.\\nAs shown in Figure 1, in the question answer-\\ning task, we represent the input question and pas-\\nsage as a single packed sequence, with the ques-\\ntion using the A embedding and the passage using\\nthe B embedding. We only introduce a start vec-\\ntor S ∈ RH and an end vector E ∈ RH during\\nﬁne-tuning. The probability of word i being the\\nstart of the answer span is computed as a dot prod-\\nuct between Ti and S followed by a softmax over\\nall of the words in the paragraph: Pi = eS·Ti\\nj\\neS·Tj\\n.\\nThe analogous formula is used for the end of the\\nanswer span. The score of a candidate span from\\nposition i to position j is deﬁned as S·Ti + E·Tj,\\nand the maximum scoring span where j ≥ i is\\nused as a prediction. The training objective is the\\nsum of the log-likelihoods of the correct start and\\nend positions. We ﬁne-tune for 3 epochs with a\\nlearning rate of 5e-5 and a batch size of 32.\\nTable 2 shows top leaderboard entries as well\\nas results from top published systems (Seo et al.,\\n2017; Clark and Gardner, 2018; Peters et al.,\\n2018a; Hu et al., 2018). The top results from the\\nSQuAD leaderboard do not have up-to-date public\\nsystem descriptions available,11 and are allowed to\\nuse any public data when training their systems.\\nWe therefore use modest data augmentation in\\nour system by ﬁrst ﬁne-tuning on TriviaQA (Joshi\\net al., 2017) befor ﬁne-tuning on SQuAD.\\nOur best performing system outperforms the top\\nleaderboard system by +1.5 F1 in ensembling and\\n+1.3 F1 as a single system.

Given a sen-\\ntence, the task is to choose the most plausible con-\\ntinuation among four choices.\\nWhen ﬁne-tuning on the SWAG dataset, we\\nconstruct four input sequences, each containing\\nthe concatenation of the given sentence (sentence\\nA) and a possible continuation (sentence B). The\\nonly task-speciﬁc parameters introduced is a vec-\\ntor whose dot product with the [CLS] token rep-\\nresentation C denotes a score for each choice\\nwhich is normalized with a softmax layer.\\nWe ﬁne-tune the model for 3 epochs with a\\nlearning rate of 2e-5 and a batch size of 16.

The left-only constraint\\nwas also applied at ﬁne-tuning, because removing\\nit introduced a pre-train/ﬁne-tune mismatch that\\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\\nusing our larger training dataset, our input repre-\\nsentation, and our ﬁne-tuning scheme.\\nWe ﬁrst examine the impact brought by the NSP\\ntask. In Table 5, we show that removing NSP\\nhurts performance signiﬁcantly on QNLI, MNLI,\\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\\nparing “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR\\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right-\\nside context. In order to make a good faith at-\\ntempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\\nsigniﬁcantly improve results on SQuAD, but the\\nresults are still far worse than those of the pre-\\ntrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod-\\nels, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL\\nmodel would not be able to condition the answer\\non the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful\\nthan a deep bidirectional model, since it can use\\nboth left and right context at every layer.\\n5.2 Effect of Model Size\\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size\\non ﬁne-tuning task accuracy. We trained a number\\nof BERT models with a differing number of layers,\\nhidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise\\nusing the same hyperparameters and training pro-\\ncedure as described previously.\\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in\\nTable 6. In this table, we report the average Dev\\nSet accuracy from 5 random restarts of ﬁne-tuning.\\nWe can see that larger models lead to a strict ac-\\ncuracy improvement across all four datasets, even\\nfor MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled train-\\ning examples, and is substantially different from\\nthe pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surpris-\\ning that we are able to achieve such signiﬁcant\\nimprovements on top of models which are al-\\nready quite large relative to the existing literature.\\nFor example, the largest Transformer explored in\\nVaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16)\\nwith 100M parameters for the encoder, and the\\nlargest Transformer we have found in the literature\\nis (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters\\n(Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERTBASE\\ncontains 110M parameters and BERTLARGE con-\\ntains 340M parameters.\\nIt has long been known that increasing the\\nmodel size will lead to continual improvements\\non large-scale tasks such as machine translation\\nand language modeling, which is demonstrated\\nby the LM perplexity of held-out training data\\nshown in Table 6. However, we believe that\\nthis is the ﬁrst work to demonstrate convinc-\\ningly that scaling to extreme model sizes also\\nleads to large improvements on very small scale\\ntasks, provided that the model has been sufﬁ-\\nciently pre-trained. Peters et al. (2018b) presented\\x0cmixed results on the downstream task impact of\\nincreasing the pre-trained bi-LM size from two\\nto four layers and Melamud et al. (2016) men-\\ntioned in passing that increasing hidden dimen-\\nsion size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing\\nfurther to 1,000 did not bring further improve-\\nments. Both of these prior works used a feature-\\nbased approach — we hypothesize that when the\\nmodel is ﬁne-tuned directly on the downstream\\ntasks and uses only a very small number of ran-\\ndomly initialized additional parameters, the task-\\nspeciﬁc models can beneﬁt from the larger, more\\nexpressive pre-trained representations even when\\ndownstream task data is very small.\\n5.3 Feature-based Approach with BERT\\nAll of the BERT results presented so far have used\\nthe ﬁne-tuning approach, where a simple classiﬁ-\\ncation layer is added to the pre-trained model, and\\nall parameters are jointly ﬁne-tuned on a down-\\nstream task. However, the feature-based approach,\\nwhere ﬁxed features are extracted from the pre-\\ntrained model, has certain advantages. First, not\\nall tasks can be easily represented by a Trans-\\nformer encoder architecture, and therefore require\\na task-speciﬁc model architecture to be added.\\nSecond, there are major computational beneﬁts\\nto pre-compute an expensive representation of the\\ntraining data once and then run many experiments\\nwith cheaper models on top of this representation.\\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches\\nby applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named\\nEntity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang\\nand De Meulder, 2003). In the input to BERT, we\\nuse a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we\\ninclude the maximal document context provided\\nby the data. Following standard practice, we for-\\nmulate this as a tagging task but do not use a CRF\\nHyperparams Dev Set Accuracy\\n#L #H #A LM (ppl) MNLI-m MRPC SST-2\\n3 768 12 5.84 77.9 79.8 88.4\\n6 768 3 5.24 80.6 82.2 90.7\\n6 768 12 4.68 81.9 84.8 91.3\\n12 768 12 3.99 84.4 86.7 92.9\\n12 1024 16 3.54 85.7 86.9 93.3\\n24 1024 16 3.23 86.6 87.8 93.7\\nTable 6: Ablation over BERT model size. #L = the\\nnumber of layers; #H = hidden size; #A = number of at-\\ntention heads. “LM (ppl)” is the masked LM perplexity\\nof held-out training data.\\nSystem Dev F1 Test F1\\nELMo (Peters et al., 2018a) 95.7 92.2\\nCVT (Clark et al., 2018) - 92.6\\nCSE (Akbik et al., 2018) - 93.1\\nFine-tuning approach\\nBERTLARGE 96.6 92.8\\nBERTBASE 96.4 92.4\\nFeature-based approach (BERTBASE)\\nEmbeddings 91.0 -\\nSecond-to-Last Hidden 95.6 -\\nLast Hidden 94.9 -\\nWeighted Sum Last Four Hidden 95.9 -\\nConcat Last Four Hidden 96.1 -\\nWeighted Sum All 12 Layers 95.5 -\\nTable 7: CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition re-\\nsults.

We use the representation of\\nthe ﬁrst sub-token as the input to the token-level\\nclassiﬁer over the NER label set.\\nTo ablate the ﬁne-tuning approach, we apply the\\nfeature-based approach by extracting the activa-\\ntions from one or more layers without ﬁne-tuning\\nany parameters of BERT. These contextual em-\\nbeddings are used as input to a randomly initial-\\nized two-layer 768-dimensional BiLSTM before\\nthe classiﬁcation layer.\\nResults are presented in Table 7.

This\\ndemonstrates that BERT is effective for both ﬁne-\\ntuning and feature-based approaches.\\n6 Conclusion\\nRecent empirical improvements due to transfer\\nlearning with language models have demonstrated\\nthat rich, unsupervised pre-training is an integral\\npart of many language understanding systems. In\\nparticular, these results enable even low-resource\\ntasks to beneﬁt from deep unidirectional architec-\\ntures. Our major contribution is further general-\\nizing these ﬁndings to deep bidirectional architec-\\ntures, allowing the same pre-trained model to suc-\\ncessfully tackle a broad set of NLP tasks.\\x0cReferences\\nAlan Akbik, Duncan Blythe, and Roland Vollgraf.\\n2018.

The purpose of this is to bias the\\nrepresentation towards the actual observed\\nword.\\nThe advantage of this procedure is that the\\nTransformer encoder does not know which words\\nit will be asked to predict or which have been re-\\nplaced by random words, so it is forced to keep\\na distributional contextual representation of ev-\\nery input token. Additionally, because random\\nreplacement only occurs for 1.5% of all tokens\\n(i.e., 10% of 15%), this does not seem to harm\\nthe model’s language understanding capability. In\\nSection C.2, we evaluate the impact this proce-\\ndure.\\nCompared to standard langauge model training,\\nthe masked LM only make predictions on 15% of\\ntokens in each batch, which suggests that more\\npre-training steps may be required for the model\\x0cBERT (Ours)\\nTrm Trm Trm\\nTrm Trm Trm\\n...\\n...\\nTrm Trm Trm\\nTrm Trm Trm\\n...\\n...\\nOpenAI GPT\\nLstm\\nELMo\\nLstm Lstm\\nLstm Lstm Lstm\\nLstm Lstm Lstm\\nLstm Lstm Lstm\\nT\\n1\\nT\\n2\\nT\\nN\\n...\\n...\\n...\\n...\\n...\\nE\\n1\\nE\\n2\\nE\\nN\\n...\\nT\\n1\\nT\\n2\\nT\\nN\\n...\\nE\\n1\\nE\\n2\\nE\\nN\\n...\\nT\\n1\\nT\\n2\\nT\\nN\\n...\\nE\\n1\\nE\\n2\\nE\\nN\\n...\\nFigure 3: Differences in pre-training model architectures. BERT uses a bidirectional Transformer. OpenAI GPT\\nuses a left-to-right Transformer. ELMo uses the concatenation of independently trained left-to-right and right-to-\\nleft LSTMs to generate features for downstream tasks. Among the three, only BERT representations are jointly\\nconditioned on both left and right context in all layers. In addition to the architecture differences, BERT and\\nOpenAI GPT are ﬁne-tuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based approach.\\nto converge. In Section C.1 we demonstrate that\\nMLM does converge marginally slower than a left-\\nto-right model (which predicts every token), but\\nthe empirical improvements of the MLM model\\nfar outweigh the increased training cost.\\nNext Sentence Prediction The next sentence\\nprediction task can be illustrated in the following\\nexamples.\\nInput = [CLS] the man went to [MASK] store [SEP]\\nhe bought a gallon [MASK] milk [SEP]\\nLabel = IsNext\\nInput = [CLS] the man [MASK] to the store [SEP]\\npenguin [MASK] are flight ##less birds [SEP]\\nLabel = NotNext\\nA.2 Pre-training Procedure\\nTo generate each training input sequence, we sam-\\nple two spans of text from the corpus, which we\\nrefer to as “sentences” even though they are typ-\\nically much longer than single sentences (but can\\nbe shorter also). The ﬁrst sentence receives the A\\nembedding and the second receives the B embed-\\nding. 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence\\nthat follows A and 50% of the time it is a random\\nsentence, which is done for the “next sentence pre-\\ndiction” task. They are sampled such that the com-\\nbined length is ≤ 512 tokens. The LM masking is\\napplied after WordPiece tokenization with a uni-\\nform masking rate of 15%, and no special consid-\\neration given to partial word pieces.\\nWe train with batch size of 256 sequences (256\\nsequences * 512 tokens = 128,000 tokens/batch)\\nfor 1,000,000 steps, which is approximately 40\\nepochs over the 3.3 billion word corpus. We\\nuse Adam with learning rate of 1e-4, β1 = 0.9,\\nβ2 = 0.999, L2 weight decay of 0.01, learning\\nrate warmup over the ﬁrst 10,000 steps, and linear\\ndecay of the learning rate. We use a dropout prob-\\nability of 0.1 on all layers. We use a gelu acti-\\nvation (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) rather than\\nthe standard relu, following OpenAI GPT. The\\ntraining loss is the sum of the mean masked LM\\nlikelihood and the mean next sentence prediction\\nlikelihood.\\nTraining of BERTBASE was performed on 4\\nCloud TPUs in Pod conﬁguration (16 TPU chips\\ntotal).13 Training of BERTLARGE was performed\\non 16 Cloud TPUs (64 TPU chips total). Each pre-\\ntraining took 4 days to complete.\\nLonger sequences are disproportionately expen-\\nsive because attention is quadratic to the sequence\\nlength. To speed up pretraing in our experiments,\\nwe pre-train the model with sequence length of\\n128 for 90% of the steps. Then, we train the rest\\n10% of the steps of sequence of 512 to learn the\\npositional embeddings.\\nA.3 Fine-tuning Procedure\\nFor ﬁne-tuning, most model hyperparameters are\\nthe same as in pre-training, with the exception of\\nthe batch size, learning rate, and number of train-\\ning epochs. The dropout probability was always\\nkept at 0.1. The optimal hyperparameter values\\nare task-speciﬁc, but we found the following range\\nof possible values to work well across all tasks:\\n• Batch size: 16, 32\\n13https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/06/Cloud-\\nTPU-now-offers-preemptible-pricing-and-global-\\navailability.html\\x0c• Learning rate (Adam): 5e-5, 3e-5, 2e-5\\n• Number of epochs: 2, 3, 4\\nWe also observed that large data sets (e.g.,\\n100k+ labeled training examples) were far less\\nsensitive to hyperparameter choice than small data\\nsets. Fine-tuning is typically very fast, so it is rea-\\nsonable to simply run an exhaustive search over\\nthe above parameters and choose the model that\\nperforms best on the development set.\\nA.4 Comparison of BERT, ELMo ,and\\nOpenAI GPT\\nHere we studies the differences in recent popular\\nrepresentation learning models including ELMo,\\nOpenAI GPT and BERT. The comparisons be-\\ntween the model architectures are shown visually\\nin Figure 3. Note that in addition to the architec-\\nture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are ﬁne-\\ntuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based\\napproach.\\nThe most comparable existing pre-training\\nmethod to BERT is OpenAI GPT, which trains a\\nleft-to-right Transformer LM on a large text cor-\\npus. In fact, many of the design decisions in BERT\\nwere intentionally made to make it as close to\\nGPT as possible so that the two methods could be\\nminimally compared. The core argument of this\\nwork is that the bi-directionality and the two pre-\\ntraining tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for\\nthe majority of the empirical improvements, but\\nwe do note that there are several other differences\\nbetween how BERT and GPT were trained:\\n• GPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M\\nwords); BERT is trained on the BooksCor-\\npus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M\\nwords).\\n• GPT uses a sentence separator ([SEP]) and\\nclassiﬁer token ([CLS]) which are only in-\\ntroduced at ﬁne-tuning time; BERT learns\\n[SEP], [CLS] and sentence A/B embed-\\ndings during pre-training.\\n• GPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch\\nsize of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for\\n1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words.\\n• GPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for\\nall ﬁne-tuning experiments; BERT chooses a\\ntask-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning learning rate which\\nperforms the best on the development set.\\nTo isolate the effect of these differences, we per-\\nform ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which\\ndemonstrate that the majority of the improvements\\nare in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks\\nand the bidirectionality they enable.\\nA.5 Illustrations of Fine-tuning on Different\\nTasks\\nThe illustration of ﬁne-tuning BERT on different\\ntasks can be seen in Figure 4. Our task-speciﬁc\\nmodels are formed by incorporating BERT with\\none additional output layer, so a minimal num-\\nber of parameters need to be learned from scratch.\\nAmong the tasks, (a) and (b) are sequence-level\\ntasks while (c) and (d) are token-level tasks. In\\nthe ﬁgure, E represents the input embedding, Ti\\nrepresents the contextual representation of token i,\\n[CLS] is the special symbol for classiﬁcation out-\\nput, and [SEP] is the special symbol to separate\\nnon-consecutive token sequences.\\nB Detailed Experimental Setup\\nB.1 Detailed Descriptions for the GLUE\\nBenchmark Experiments.\\nOur GLUE results in Table1 are obtained\\nfrom https://gluebenchmark.com/\\nleaderboard and https://blog.\\nopenai.com/language-unsupervised.\\nThe GLUE benchmark includes the following\\ndatasets, the descriptions of which were originally\\nsummarized in Wang et al.

For example, we\\ndid observe substantial improvements on RTE from multi-\\ntask training with MNLI.\\n15https://gluebenchmark.com/faq\\x0cjority class.\\nC Additional Ablation Studies\\nC.1 Effect of Number of Training Steps\\nFigure 5 presents MNLI Dev accuracy after ﬁne-\\ntuning from a checkpoint that has been pre-trained\\nfor k steps. This allows us to answer the following\\nquestions:\\n1. Question: Does BERT really need such\\na large amount of pre-training (128,000\\nwords/batch * 1,000,000 steps) to achieve\\nhigh ﬁne-tuning accuracy?\\nAnswer: Yes, BERTBASE achieves almost\\n1.0% additional accuracy on MNLI when\\ntrained on 1M steps compared to 500k steps.\\n2. Question: Does MLM pre-training converge\\nslower than LTR pre-training, since only 15%\\nof words are predicted in each batch rather\\nthan every word?\\nAnswer: The MLM model does converge\\nslightly slower than the LTR model. How-\\never, in terms of absolute accuracy the MLM\\nmodel begins to outperform the LTR model\\nalmost immediately.\\nC.2 Ablation for Different Masking\\nProcedures\\nIn Section 3.1, we mention that BERT uses a\\nmixed strategy for masking the target tokens when\\npre-training with the masked language model\\n(MLM) objective. The following is an ablation\\nstudy to evaluate the effect of different masking\\nstrategies.\\n200 400 600 800 1,000\\n76\\n78\\n80\\n82\\n84\\nPre-training Steps (Thousands)\\nMNLI Dev Accuracy\\nBERTBASE (Masked LM)\\nBERTBASE (Left-to-Right)\\nFigure 5: Ablation over number of training steps. This\\nshows the MNLI accuracy after ﬁne-tuning, starting\\nfrom model parameters that have been pre-trained for\\nk steps. The x-axis is the value of k.\\nNote that the purpose of the masking strategies\\nis to reduce the mismatch between pre-training\\nand ﬁne-tuning, as the [MASK] symbol never ap-\\npears during the ﬁne-tuning stage. We report the\\nDev results for both MNLI and NER. For NER,\\nwe report both ﬁne-tuning and feature-based ap-\\nproaches, as we expect the mismatch will be am-\\npliﬁed for the feature-based approach as the model\\nwill not have the chance to adjust the representa-\\ntions.\\nMasking Rates Dev Set Results\\nMASK SAME RND MNLI NER\\nFine-tune Fine-tune Feature-based\\n80% 10% 10% 84.2 95.4 94.9\\n100% 0% 0% 84.3 94.9 94.0\\n80% 0% 20% 84.1 95.2 94.6\\n80% 20% 0% 84.4 95.2 94.7\\n0% 20% 80% 83.7 94.8 94.6\\n0% 0% 100% 83.6 94.9 94.6\\nTable 8: Ablation over different masking strategies.\\nThe results are presented in Table 8. In the table,\\nMASK means that we replace the target token with\\nthe [MASK] symbol for MLM; SAME means that\\nwe keep the target token as is; RND means that\\nwe replace the target token with another random\\ntoken.\\nThe numbers in the left part of the table repre-\\nsent the probabilities of the speciﬁc strategies used\\nduring MLM pre-training (BERT uses 80%, 10%,\\n10%). The right part of the paper represents the\\nDev set results. For the feature-based approach,\\nwe concatenate the last 4 layers of BERT as the\\nfeatures, which was shown to be the best approach\\nin Section 5.3.\\nFrom the table it can be seen that ﬁne-tuning is\\nsurprisingly robust to different masking strategies.\\nHowever, as expected, using only the MASK strat-\\negy was problematic when applying the feature-\\nbased approach to NER. Interestingly, using only\\nthe RND strategy performs much worse than our\\nstrategy as well.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'name': 'bert.pdf'}, 'embedding': None, 'id': 'c2b55becdc215bc618f0c9509f8db0ab'}>]\n"
